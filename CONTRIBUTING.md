## Code of Conduct

Common sense dictates that "being nice" is a requirement for working together. But to be clear,
we wrote some guidelines in our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How can I contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before reporting an issue

Before reporting an issue, please check for [previously reported issues][1]. If the issue is already
known **and still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### When reporting an issue

When reporting an [issue on GutHub][1], explain the problem and include details to help people to
reproduce the problem:

* **Descriptive Title**  
    For example, *"Icons too small on 4k monitors"* is a better title than *"problem with icons"*.
* **Steps to reproduce**  
    Describe what you did and how you did it when the problem occurred. For example, it makes a
    difference whether you are referring to a *menu entry* or a *button on the toolbar* even though
    both trigger the same function.
* **Examples**  
    Screenshots are very helpful when dealing with design issues. If you know your way around source
    code, code samples may also prove to be helpful. When providing code samples, please use GitHub's
    [Markdown][2] syntax for formatting.
    
Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Version Information**  
    You can get the version in from TeamSpeak's option dialog under **Options** » **Addons** » **Themes**
    or **Options** » **Addons** » **Icon Packs** accordingly.
* **Operating System**  
    Some issues may only affect specific operating systems in specific versions. *Windows* would be
    a nice information but *Windows 10 with creator's update* would be even better.
* **Plugins**  
    Installed 3rd party plugins (i.e. not authored by *TeamSpeak Systems GmbH*) may cause side effects with themes so it would be helpful to know
    if any of those are installed. See **Options** » **Addons** » **Plugins** to see a list of
    enabled plugins.
